# AI-Driven-Banking-Delay-Fraud-Detection-System-WIP-
This repository contains an ongoing project focused on detecting payment delays and banking fraud using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to build a robust, end-to-end machine learning pipeline capable of identifying anomalous patterns in loan repayments, transaction behaviors, and potential fraudulent activities within financial systems.

⚠️ Work in Progress:
This project is currently under active development.
All models, datasets, notebooks, and methodologies are preliminary, subject to significant improvements, restructuring, or replacement as the project evolves. Nothing presented here should be considered final or production-ready.
